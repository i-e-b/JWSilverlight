JW Silverlight
==============
A jw-player compatible Silverlight application.
Requires Silverlight 3 or above. Can play SmoothStreaming 1 and 1.5 presentations.

Support for captions and playlists is built in.

Note-- there is a bug in the current JW embedder that causes flash to be loaded for just about everything,
to work around this, make sure that Silverlight comes first in the modes list

Current Status:
---------------
Works with a range of JWPlayer skins.
Some behaviour is slightly different from the Flash JW player, but not more than HTML5 version is!
Majority of functionality is now supported; Flash plugins and SWF skins will never be supported, but if anything else fails please let me know.
