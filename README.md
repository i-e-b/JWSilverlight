JW Silverlight
==============
A jw-player compatible Silverlight application.
Requires Silverlight 3 or above. Can play SmoothStreaming 1 and 1.5 presentations.

Support for captions and playlists to be built-in.

Note-- there is a bug in the current JW embedder that causes flash to be loaded for just about everything,
to work around this, make sure that Silverlight comes first in the modes list

Current Status:
---------------
Works with a range of JWPlayer skins.
Some behaviour is slightly different from the Flash JW player, but not more than HTML5 version is!
Should be usable for simple player projects.

JavaScript embedding and interface aren't done yet.

JW Plugins aren't supported yet.
