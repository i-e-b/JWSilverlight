JW Silverlight
==============
A jw-player compatible Silverlight application.

Current Status:

Works with a range of JWPlayer skins.
Some behaviour is slightly different from the Flash JW player, but not more than HTML5 version is!
Should be usable for simple player projects.

JavaScript embedding and interface aren't done yet.

JW Plugins aren't supported yet.
